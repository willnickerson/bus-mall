## Developer Stories

- As the developer, I want to keep track of the number of clicks and views for each item.

- As the developer, I want to store the click and view data and compile it into an easily understandable graph for the start-up so that they will easily be able to make product decisions.

- As the developer, I want make a straightforward and clear interface for the user, so that they are easily able to complete the product survey.

- As the developer, I want insure that the group of users sees all of the products a more or less equal number of times, so that the survey data is accurate.

- As the developer, I want to make sure that users do not see a product twice in the same group of items, and that there are no repeat products in two subsequent groups of products.
